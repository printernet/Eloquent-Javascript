# My solutions for the exercises from the book Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke.

**I make no claim to the quality of these solutions, they are merely my casual attempts at solving the exercises contained in the book**

When there are more than one version of a particular exercise it indicates that I made another attempt at a later time. Sometimes this was because I wanted to see if I came up with a different, better or worse solution when I revisited the problem. Other times it was because I felt like I could either accomplish the exercise either in less code, or more elegantly.
